# records-assignment
This is a small coding project done as an interview assignment. To run the project, make sure you have both send_records_to_server.py and single_alert_object.py.

The other files are used for internal testing purposes. gordon_test_server is a simple XML RPC server I set up to make sure my process_alert function in the main part of the code would work. input.txt is the file of inputs I tested the code on, and test.py is used to make sure that I had a test case for running my main program as both a module and a script.
